## DEV EXERCISE - MINESWEEPER

This is my implementation of the game Minesweeper in Javascript with ReacJS and Typescript.

This implementacion has the next features acording to the challenge:
  - one level of dificulty (fixed 10x10 board with 10 hidden bombs randomly generated).
  - timer display (starts counting at the start of the game).
  - restart button (the icon button with the smile face).
  - flag & "?" markers on right click.
  - auto reveal adjacent cells when an empty cell is pressed.

## Installation

clone the project from:

`git clone https://github.com/jhlescano/dev-exercise-minesweeper.git`

move to the cloned directory and proceed to install all dependencies

`npm install` or `npm i`

and run the project:

`npm run start`

and then access to http://localhost:3000 (by default runs on port 3000 otherwise runs on the next available port).
